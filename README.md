by Drew Immerman

https://github.com/DrewImm/ogl-base

This is a base project for OpenGL C++ development.

It includes the following libraries:

- OpenGL
- GLEW
- GLFW
- GLM

## Download

Git clone this repository for the latest version

```
git clone https://github.com/DrewImm/ogl-base .
```

## Customize

You will probably want your project and files to be called something other than "ogl-base".  Just run

```
./script/create-app {NEW_PROJECT_NAME}
```

This will initialize a new git repo for you, and rename your app.  This will build your app for you

## Development Build

If you would like to build this repo for development purposes without creating a new app, run

```
./script/build
```

## Build

You can now build your app by opening the project in build/
